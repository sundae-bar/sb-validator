# This document will be used to generate a list of recommended hardware for your subnet.

# This is intended to give a rough estimate of the minimum requirements

    # Additional network requirements:
    # - Stable internet connection required for API calls to:
    #   - Coordinator API (task polling, result submission)
    #   - Letta server (agent execution)
    #   - Third-party model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    #   - Bittensor network (weight submission, if enabled)
